# DataAnalysis_GalaxyMap
Mapping planets with data visualisation tools

In this project I utilize the data from Star Wars Planets csv file (data set of information scraped from Star Wars wiki site for the purpose of my another project - Planet Data Analysis), to present all planets with available coordinates data on the chart presenting Galaxy Map.
On created Map I conducted brief analysis, presenting other key aspects concerning Star Wars planets and relations between them.

For the purpose of this project I used key data analysis and visualisation python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
